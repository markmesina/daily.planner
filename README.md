## Code Snippet

levraging jQuery for this calander simplified both the events that store user input to local storage as well as retrieveing them to be displayed on the page when the user refreshes the browser. By using specific id's correlating with the time of day we can retreive the varible stored in realtion to the onlcick that stored it.

```js

$(".rowBtn").on("click", function() {
    var timeOfday = $(this).parent().attr("id");
    var textContent = $("input").val().trim();

    localStorage.setItem(timeOfday, textContent);
    console.log(timeOfday, textContent);
});

```
